As of 2.17.21:

Virtual Tour - PKI

The application is a simulation of the PKI building (parts of the building) and acts as a standin for the on campus Open House in addition to acting as a way for prospective 
students to view the campus and its faculty as well as learning about specific majors and programs offered by the college in an interesting and interactive way.

Deployment/How to use application:
The application is built in Unity and is deployed in a WebGL build for easy access for the most users. In order to run the application it is as simple as executing the application
which will then open the application in a browser (recommend Firefox). This is to prevent users from having to download the game/application and instead allow them to quickly
deploy it via their browser. However, as the application increases in size and intricasy, the deployment may need to be changed to an executable build in which case the users will
have to download the build and execute it from the download.

Features: Below is a list of specific features that the application implements in order to act as a good simulation and college information provider:

- Virtual Recreation of certain areas of PKI (not 1:1 but close approximations)
- Avatars of actual faculty members who speak to the user via prerecorded messages
- Presentation of videos by professors about specific majors and programs offered within the college
- Triggers for the avatars and videos so that audio and video are activated and not constantly playing in addition to proximity volume
- In-game activities for the player to play that provide information about the college in a fun and interesting way
- Simple avatar customization
